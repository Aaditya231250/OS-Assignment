# This workflow automatically builds and tests your xv6 code when you push

name: xv6 Build and Test

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Build Docker image
      run: docker-compose build
    
    - name: Verify Docker image
      run: docker-compose run --rm xv6-dev bash -c "echo 'Container built successfully'"
    
    # Uncomment below when xv6 source is added to repository
    # - name: Build xv6
    #   run: docker-compose run --rm xv6-dev bash -c "cd /xv6 && make"
    
    # - name: Run Part A tests
    #   run: docker-compose run --rm xv6-dev bash -c "cd /xv6 && timeout 30 make qemu-nox < test_parta_input.txt"
    
    # Note: Automated testing of xv6 in CI is challenging due to QEMU interaction
    # The above examples are starting points - you'll need to create test scripts
    # that can run non-interactively
